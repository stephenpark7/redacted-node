Core Features:
  ☐ You can be anonymous if you choose to ( username ) - but every post has an identifier unique to the user and the thread ( username + thread id ). so that someone can't just post as you in the same thread. you can  create multiple accounts though if you want to be anonymous in the same thread.
  ☐ Can still get karma even if you're anonymous
